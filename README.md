# EvenCops
Standing Against the Odds between you and justice.

## It's a Web Platform !
EvenCops is an initiative to stop the crime and bring justice to society and as well as to those who need it.
It's an online Platform for filing Complaints, tracking them and getting them resolved doing justice.
It is an online public complaint portal as well evidence collection portal where one can
- complaint about the crime
- give alert regarding any kind of suspicious activity in the locality
- provide any kind of necessary information regarding the suspects that may help in carrying on court procedures and after then
legal action towards the suspect.

## Do we really need that ?
There are a number of arguments that support the need for this system. Following points can be considered a starting point :
1. Even if victims recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered.
2. The enforcers formally appointed by the State often have better access to  expertise and resources.
3. In some cases, victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for deterrence.
4. Fear of retaliation may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a trial.
5. Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court.

## A fact on top of Enough Arguments
More than 50% of crimes in our capital city goes unreported.
<br/>Still rate of Cognizable crime has increased to 180% during 2012 â€“ 2015.

### I think we have already a platform like that, but I can't point it right now .
Yes there is and should be certainly,but
<br/>
`Exploration of Mars doesn't depends on silly question like
"Earth is still beautiful and can support us for another billion years. then Why Mars ?"`. 
<br/>
That's kind of stupid analogy, but I think you get my point.
